This project involves analyzing a sample dataset using Google Sheets to gain insights into customer behavior related to bike purchases. The analysis includes creating pivot tables to explore key metrics, visualizing these metrics through charts, and providing interactivity with slicers on a dedicated dashboard.

How to Use the Dashboard

Open the Workbook:
Open the [BikePurchaseAnalysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nPJaNO8JT6Tmgvu4Gq4XoNbdD91xybOyLBrLd69RPK4/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Sheets.
Navigate to the Dashboard:
Click on the "Dashboard" sheet to view the interactive dashboard.
Interact with the Slicers:
Use the slicers to filter the data based on different criteria (e.g., Bike Purchase Status, Region, Age Bracket).
Observe how the charts update automatically to reflect your selections.
Key Learnings

Pivot Tables: Learned how to create and configure pivot tables to summarize and analyze large datasets effectively.
Chart Creation: Gained experience in visualizing data through various chart types to present insights clearly.
Slicers for Interactivity: Implemented slicers to add interactivity to the dashboard, allowing for dynamic data exploration.
